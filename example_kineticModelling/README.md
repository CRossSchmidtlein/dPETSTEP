ex_dPETSTEP_kineticModelling

An example data file and a script to run a simulation and subsequent model parameter fitting of the simulated data.

1.  Unpack the zip file. It contains three files, one with data, one with a main script, and one with loadable settings for GUI usage.
2.1 Run the simulation via GUI in Matlab:
	>> dPETSTEPgui_sim
	load the settings .xls file
2.2 Run the simulation via the main script from Matlab prompt:
    >> main_ex_dPETSTEP_kineitcModelling
